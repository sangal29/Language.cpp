 Note 1 -


 when we try to write a code to convert decimal to binary number rember one thing that 
 always we multiply and divide by 2 and in product multiply by 10 


point to rember

 int rem = number % 10;
         ans += rem* product;
        number /= 10;
        product  *= 2;


Note 2 

when we try to convert binary to decimal we simply remeber one thing that is  
divde by 10 to seprate the value and multiply by 2 in product 

point to rember

int rem = num % 10;
      sum += ( rem * product);
      num /= 10;
      product *=2;
